## Install

Work in progress. If you’re just finding this repo on GitHub, it may not
be ready yet.

``` sh
pip install fad_pytorch
```

## About

Features: - runs in parallel on multiple GPUs - favors 48kHz sample
rates - can use CLAP embeddings - favors ops in PyTorch instead of
numpy - allows dataset access via WebDataSet (s3)

This is designed to be run as 3 command-line scripts in succession:

1.  `fad_gen.py`: produces directories of real & fake audio
2.  `fad_embed.py`: produces directories of *embeddings* of real & fake
    audio
3.  `fad_score.py`: reads the embeddings & generates FAD score, for real
    (“$r$”) and fake (“$f$”):

$$ FAD = || \mu_r - \mu_f ||^2 + tr\left(\Sigma_r + \Sigma_f - 2 \sqrt{\Sigma_r \Sigma_f}\right)$$

There are \[several\] others, but this one is mine. These repos didn’t
have all the features I wanted, but I used them for inspiration: \*
